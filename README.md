# Divine Fury

This mod adds a new charm to Hollow Knight: Divine Fury. 

Divine Fury sets the player's health to 1, making it easier to trigger Fury of the Fallen in Godhome battles. It is fully compatible with Joni's Blessing, Lifeblood Heart and Lifeblood Core.

This mod doesn't affect lifeblood masks gained from BlueHealthHook, such as those from the Exaltation mod.
