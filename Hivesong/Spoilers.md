# Spoilers

This mod can be found in the last room before the Hive Knight. Specifically, it is in the secret tunnel at the top of the room which leads to the second Hive grub. It will be in the small alcove on the left.

Hivesong increases the damage of each pet by 33%, for a minimum of 1. So Grimmchild (max) will deal 15 damage instead of 11, Weaverlings will deal 4 damage instead of 3, etc.

If Exaltation is installed and active, Hivesong can be upgraded to Royal Decree by defeating ascended Hive Knight. Royal Decree increases pet damage by 66% instead of 33%
