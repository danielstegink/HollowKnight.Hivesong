This mod can be found in the last room before the Hive Knight. Specifically, it is in the secret tunnel at the top of the room which leads to the second Hive grub. It will be in the small alcove on the left.

Hivesong increases the damage of each pet by 30%, for a minimum of 1. So Grimmchild (max) will deal 14 damage instead of 11, Weaverlings will deal 4 damage instead of 3, etc.
