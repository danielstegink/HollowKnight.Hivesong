# Hivesong

This mod adds a new charm to Hollow Knight, Hivesong, which increases the damage dealt by pets. This charm synergizes with Grimmchild, Glowing Womb, Weaversong and Flukenest.

# Patch Notes
1.1.0.0
-	Simplified code for buffing pets
-	Fixed bug preventing Dung Flukes from being buffed. Now when a Dung Fluke explodes, the dung cloud it generates will have its damage rate increased
